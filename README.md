## Project Overview

This repository showcases my expertise as a **Data Analyst**, **Business Analyst**, and **Data Engineer** by building a scalable, production-ready **data warehouse** solution using NYC Taxi and Sample Superstore datasets. The project highlights key data engineering and analytics skills such as:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes for high-quality, reliable data  
- **Dimensional Modeling:** Creating efficient **fact tables** and **dimension tables** (e.g., `dim_customer`) optimized for fast querying and business reporting  
- **Incremental Data Pipelines:** Implementing accretive data loading to keep data current without duplication  
- **Data Quality & Integrity:** Handling duplicates, missing data, and inconsistent formats with best practices  
- **Query Optimization & Performance Tuning:** Writing modular, efficient Python scripts using `pandas` and leveraging optimized data structures  
- **Automation & Workflow Management:** Scripted pipelines for seamless, repeatable data ingestion and processing

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JacsenW/NYC-Taxi-Data-Warehouse.git
   cd NYC-Taxi-Data-Warehouse
Install Python dependencies
pip install pandas
Run data pipeline scripts

Example:
python scripts/dim_customer_pipeline.py
Inspect generated data tables
Processed dimension tables like dim_customer.csv are saved in the data/ directory for further analysis or integration.

Troubleshooting
UnicodeDecodeError when reading CSVs
Issue: Incorrect file encoding
Solution: Use encoding='ISO-8859-1' in pd.read_csv() calls

Git push rejected due to remote changes
Issue: Remote repository has updates not present locally
Solution: Run git pull --rebase to sync before pushing

Missing Python packages error
Issue: Required packages not installed
Solution: Run pip install pandas or relevant libraries

File not found errors
Issue: Incorrect working directory or file paths
Solution: Use absolute paths or confirm your directory before executing scripts

If other issues arise, feel free to open an issue or contact me.
